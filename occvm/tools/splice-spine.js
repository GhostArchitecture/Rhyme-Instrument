/* occvm/tools/splice-spine.js — put the spine into a tool, idempotently.
 *
 * The 2.0 migration process (section 0b) sets the rules this obeys:
 *   1. the generated region is fenced and never hand-edited
 *   2. the generator's input is the source; the spliced copy is an artifact
 *   3. regeneration is idempotent — unchanged input yields a byte-identical block
 *   4. the ritual runs before the diff, not after
 *   5. (2.8) a retired part's block is removed, and --check fails while one lingers
 *
 * Both repositories already had an author-time generation step (Rhyme's build.js, BTC's
 * units/tools/resplice.js), so this extends an existing practice rather than starting a habit.
 *
 * The spine has two parts, and migration section 0 anticipates exactly this shape: the constants are
 * CSS, and the light-dependent half is one resolver, JS only, because both consumers are browser tools.
 *
 * Usage:  node occvm/tools/splice-spine.js [--check] [part ...]
 *         --check verifies every spliced region matches its source and exits nonzero if not.

   the numeric face, which lives only where mono is rendered, and it sits beside occvm/golden/ because

   else it reads it reads inside ambientFloor, which nothing calls while the file evaluates. That
   closes the 2.0 defect by construction instead of by ordering — fracture.js captured a null
   OCCVM_VEINS at load, threw on every call in the browser, and passed in Node because `require`
   resolved it. `test/occvm.js` asserts the property: no sibling global is referenced at this part's
   top level. Where it actually lands is insertion history, not the list: parts go in after one anchor,
